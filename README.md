# SlugGame
This is a simple movement game made using the Pygame library. 

The objective is to collect points randomly located around the map while avoiding the evil slug who will chase you if you enter his sight range.

Although you move slowly, you can boost yourself for a quick getaway or to increase the points you collect. But be careful, if you boost too much, you'll run out of energy!
